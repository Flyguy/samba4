Debian Stretch, the minimal things for a MEMBER server. 
( debian stretch samba 4.5.8/4.5.12 )

Part 2 The "Samba MEMBER" (FILE-SERVER) server setup, what about the share and security rights. 
By example. ( This is a Work in Progress) 

######## MEMBER SHARE DEFINITIONS ################
# READ: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/vfs_acl_xattr.8.html
# ! You must configure the share and security rights with a windows client when you set: acl_xattr:ignore system acl = yes
# After setting this, makes sure, you have restarted samba, then configure the share and security rights.
# (see: https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_Share_Using_Windows_ACLs)
# Best is to dont mix posix and Windows ACL settings in a share. ! 
# Setup the share as POSIX ACL or Windows ACL.
# ( Not that it wont work, but it wil make your setup harder to maintain and debug )
#
# Im asumming the following:
# - Assed "Domain Users" a GID with ADUC. ( yes, win10 missing unix tab, i used Win 7+ADUC, or use samba-tool  ) 
# - Domain users is the primary gid for every user.
# - I used Backend AD, you.... 
# Read the Advantages and Disadvantages, then you choose.

# https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Idmap_config_rid
# 
# - mkdir -p /home/samba/{profiles,users,data}
# - chmod 1751 /home/samba/  ( root:root ) (1751, Creator Owner (=root=>mapping_user=>SAMBADOM\Administrator) 
# 1751 explained.
# 1 Creator Owner
# 7 root ( maps to Administrator)
# 5 root ( maps to BUILTIN\Administrators of which Domain Admins is a member)
# 1 everyone ( everyone can enter this folder ) 
# 
# If you set your base rights in a subfolder, i suggest, 3770
# 3 Creator (owner and group) This is where "Domain Users" for all users comes in. 
# 7 (root)
# 7 (BUILTIN\Administrators
# 0 You dont want anyone enterint this folder. 
# Now root/Administrator creates a new folder in /home/samba/data/group1
#
#    ! So only Administrator (root) can create/assign rights to new folders in the samba$ ( a administrative share. )
# Now, login as SAMBADOM\Administrator with a domain joined PC, and setup your rights and folders in /home/samba
# ( tip, drive map \\$(hostname -f)\samba$ )
#
[samba$]
    # Used for Administrative things only.

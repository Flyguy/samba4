Part 1.0 The basic Debian Buster Install.

Pre-work and things to consider.

First, read this, there are rules to obey if you setup a server, this is a small checklist i follow.

The checklist for you host-name and domain-name and ip address.
This is the most important part you should think about.

You need to have this info before you install, because we don’t want to change to much after you installed your server base.

There are rules to follow to make sure you servers work as they should.
This is covert in the internet standards: Request For Change (RFC).
And per example, these 2 shown RFC’s involve the “example” setups.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761

Domain name choices for these examples/howto’s.
– StandAlone: Home use: private.example
– StandAlone/Internet/business use : example.tld
– Office domainname office.example.tld

! Dont use .local or .lan these are reserved names for Apple’s mDNS
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.local and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762.

Other good articals with examples:
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34981.active-directory-best-practices-for-internal-domain-and-network-names.aspx.
And a security consideration (Leaking DNS info): https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-144A 

And since most of my howto’s will involve a Active Directory, this is a must read :
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/909264/naming-conventions-in-active-directory-for-computers-domains-sites-and
And looking at table 6.2 here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc959336(v=technet.10)
Example of “lables” as mentioned in table 6.2
(hostname(=label).office(= label).example(= label).tld( = label)

When you combine these rules, we end up with something like this example: hostname.office.example.tld

We want to setup so its compatible for any setup.
– hostname , min 1, max 15 characters, a-Z,0-9, –
– DNS domain name, max total FQDN 254 characters, include the dot’s.
And 254-15, results in 239 characters left for the domain.tld part.

!!  The FQDN for an Active Directory domain name is limited to 64 bytes, including the dots, 
an Active directory server name example : s4dc01.office.example.tld

A FQDN = Fully Qualified Domain Name = hostname.domain.tld, can also be : hostname.office.domain.tld.
But can not be : hostname ( or any one-word domain). 

For any office use of use in combination with internet accessin your server, like web server, mailserver, vpn server then i really recommend to buy a domainname and use it. 
for about 1-2 dollar a month your set.

Or use https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Manual/DynamicDNS, a free DDNS service, there are more if these.



- The Debian Buster Install Basics. 
- Advanced Options
- Expert install
    - Language
	- Language :  English                -  English           
	- Country, territory or area: other -> Europe -> Netherlands 
	- Country to base default locale settings on:   United States        -  en_US.UTF-8
	- Additional locales: ( not really needed, its easy to add later on when needed. )

    - Access software for blind person.. skip
    
    - Configure keyboard
	- American/English
	
    - Detect and mount CDROM
	- usb-storage, ( keep default )
	
    - Load installer components from CDROM
	- ( i switch to ssh later on, so i enable network-console )
    
    - Detect network hardware  
    
    - Configure the network
	- Auto-configure networking
	    ! Yes, you can install with automatic, but then you need to correct after and move to static IP. 
		 NOTE1 After install and reboot we will use the setup-systemd-networkd.sh 
		 to generate the IPv4 compliant files for systemd-networkd 
	    This setup does not include/support IPv6. (yet) 
	
	Check the info, and if ok, hit enter.
	
    - Configure the Hostname
	- Hostname 	: server1ad
	- Domainname: internal.example.com
	    NO .local, NO .lan
	    ( results in server1ad.internal.example.com as FQDN )
    - Continue installation remotely using SSH.
	type your pass. ( user name is: installer )
	( login with ssh, and choose : Start installer (expert mode) )
    
    - Set up users and passwords
	- Enable shadow passwords? Yes
	- Allow login as root?  No     ( i say No No No... NO ...... NO  ) 
	- Fullname new user: (What you want.) Linux Admin
	- Username for your account: linuxadmin
	- Password for the new user: (default)
    - Configure the clock
	- Set the clock using NTP? Yes
		# For AD-DC's you set a external stable NTP server. 
		# For a member you set the Ipnumbers of the DC.
	    - NTP server to use:  ( choose stratum 1 server, ntp1.nl.net ) 
	    - Timezone : Europe/Amsterdam   ( if you dont see you country/region go back to language, and set that correct. )
    - Detect disks
	- Partition disks
	    Manual (started, choose Guided - user entire disk. )
		Select disk, Create Empty (msdos) table
		Select partition, Create new partition... (Stop and think.) 
		Now, here the minimal i advice is 
		/   ( a samba AD DC, needed only 1.5GB for the complete OS install, set it to 8Gb as minimal )
		/var/log ( if you get a log run, it can fillup you partion and damage a samba database, 1Gb-2Gb more the ok )
		( this example shows 6GB for / and 1Gb /var/log)
		    New ( 6GB, Primary, beginning )
			Use as 			: ext4  
			mount point		: /
			Mount option	: (SSD, select discard) ( other keep default )
			Label			: OS_/
			Reserved blocks	: 5%    
			Typical usage	: standard    ( partitions with only large files ( iso/mkv/mov ) choose largefile4 ( adviced 500Mb+ files )
			Bootable flag	: on
		    Done setting up the partition
		    
		    New ( 1GB, Logical, beginning )
			Use as 			: ext4  
			mount point		: (Enter Manualy)  /var/log
			Mount option	: (SSD, select discard) ( other optional, noatime )
			Label			: OS_/var/log
			Reserved blocks	: 5%    
			Typical usage	: standard    ( partitions with only large files ( iso/mkv/mov ) choose largefile4 ( adviced with lots of 500Mb+ files )
			Bootable flag	: off
		    Done setting up the partition
		    
		    New ( 1,6GB, Logical, beginning )
			 Use as:         swap area 
		    Done setting up the partition

		    New ( XXXX GB, Logical, beginning )		! a dedicated partion for all our samba data
			Use as 			: ext4  
			mount point		: (Enter Manualy)  /srv/samba
			Mount option	: (SSD, select discard) ( other optional, noatime )
			Label			: SRV_/SambaData
			Reserved blocks	: 5%
			Typical usage	: standard    ( partitions with only large files ( iso/mkv/mov ) choose largefile4 ( adviced 500Mb+ files )
			Bootable flag	: off
		    Done setting up the partition
			
		Finish partitioning and write changes to disk ..
		
    -  Install the base system
	    Kernel to install:       		
			linux-image-VERSIONNR-amd64
			linux-image-amd64

		If you choose linux-image-amd64, you keep following latest stable kernel ( or from backports if enabled )
		
	    Drivers to include in the initrd: 
		Now, generic is the best option
		if you know you are never going to move the server to other hardware, then targeted is an option. 
		i did choose targeted since its a VM i use, and it save me some time.
		Safest option is "Generic" ! 
		
    - Configure the package manager 
	Scan another CD or DVD? No
	Use a network mirror? Yes
	Protocol for file downloads: http ( https is better, but easy to add later on. )
	Debian archive mirror country: Netherlands   ( choose your country here ) 
	Debian archive mirror: deb.debian.org or ftp.nl.debian.org
	 ( read : http://deb.debian.org for more info about this new host. )
	HTTP proxy information (blank for none):
	Use non-free software? Yes  ( you might need (linux) firmware packages)
	Enable source repositories in APT? No
	Services to use: 	[*] security updates (from security.debian.org)
			    [*] release updates
			    [ ] backported software                                                          
	Now i did not enable backported software, we only enabled it, then its really really needed. 
	
    - Select and install software                                     
	 Participate in the package usage survey? .. what the .. , why not..  it helps debian. you choose.
	 ( and : This choice can be later modified by running "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest".)
    
    - Software selection
	SSH server
	Standard system utilities
	
	All other turn off, yes, even if you want apache or a print server, first the basics. 
	
    - Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk
	 Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?   Yes
	 Device for boot loader installation: ( for me /dev/xvda ) you /dev/sda probely.
	 Force GRUB installation to the EFI removable media path?  No, ( i suggest, you keep the default )
    
    - Finish the installation  
	Is the system clock set to UTC? ( for me Yes ) you, i suggest, keep the default.
	
    - Installation complete
	Great, Continue, and you server reboots. 
	
	- Login, sudo su -  and we going to switch to systemd-networkd now. 
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thctlo/debian-scripts/master/setup-systemd-networkd.sh 
   bash setup-systemd-networkd.sh member
   
   ! Note again, its not setup/supported for IPv6!! (yet).
   - Follow the instructions. 
   editor lan-member-dev-eno1.network  		# change the ip to static, the script tookover the DHCP ip. 
   cp lan-member-dev-eno1.network /etc/systemd/network/  # copy the adjusted file to its needed folder for systemd. 
   mv /etc/network/interfaces{,.backup} 	# backup the old interfaces file
   
   # Re-add the lo to interfaces 
   cat /etc/network/interfaces.backup |head -n9>> /etc/network/interfaces
   # daemon.log shows ifquery wants it, so we add it. 

   systemctl daemon-reload
   mv /etc/resolv.conf{,.backup} && ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
   systemctl enable systemd-networkd
   systemctl restart systemd-networkd
   systemctl enable  systemd-timesyncd
   systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
   systemctl enable  systemd-resolved
   systemctl restart systemd-resolved


   # If you need to change hostname and domainname, its now time todo it. 
   # i dont recommend it doing after you installed more software and especially samba. 
   # if you need a different hostname i suggest, use CNAME in the dns.  
   # Just make sure your dns A and PTR record are correctly set. 
   hostnamectl   # verify hostname 
   cat /etc/hosts # verify 
   rgrep old-hostname /etc/*  # verify.. 
   
   # Setting a new hostname ( without domain )
   hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname
   sed -i 's/old-hostname/new-hostname/g' /etc/hosts
   
   # correct the IP if needed if you installed with DHCP ip. 
   sed -i 's/127.0.1.1/new-IP/g' /etc/hosts
   
   # verify the ip in systemd-network
   cat /etc/systemd/network/lan-member-dev-eno1.network	 !! NOTE, eno1 is my interface, you might have a different one. 
   editor /etc/systemd/network/lan-member-dev-eno1.network
   
   systemctl daemon-reload
   
   clear all logs in /var/log  ( a dirty but effective quick clear.. ) 
   cd /var/log 
   for x in `ls` ; do > $x ; done
 !!! watch out with that, done on the wrong place and you can start over. 
   
   
   reboot

   Login and verify all logs, we dont want to day any errors.. 
   Clear the logs after you verified them.

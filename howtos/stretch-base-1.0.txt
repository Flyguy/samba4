Debian Stretch Install Basics. 
- Advanced Options
- Expert install
    - Language
	- Language :  English                -  English           
	- Country, territory or area: other -> Europe -> Netherlands 
	- Country to base default locale settings on:   United States        -  en_US.UTF-8
	- Additional locales: ( not really needed, its easy to add later on when needed. )

    - Access software for blind person.. skip
    
    - Configure keyboard
	- American/English
	
    - Detect and mount CDROM
	- usb-storage, ( keep default )
	
    - Load installer components from CDROM
	- ( i switch to ssh later on, so i enable network-console )
    
    - Detect network hardware  
    
    - Configure the network
	- Auto-configure networking
	    ! Yes, you can install with automatic, but then you need to correct other
	    setting in the system so choose NO and setup a static ipnumber. 
	server : 192.168.249.30/24 = 192.168.249.30/255.255.255.0
	Gateway : 192.168.249.1
	Nameserver: 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
	(the other AD DC DNS Nameservers: 192.168.249.212 192.168.249.211)
	Since this is a test server and it gets its own dns, set internet dns ipnumbers
	
	Check the info, and if ok, hit enter.
	
    - Configure the Hostname
	- Hostname 	: server1ad
	- Domainname: internal.example.com
	    NO .local, NO .lan
	    ( results in server1ad.internal.example.com as FQDN )
    - Continue installation remotely using SSH.
	type your pass. ( user name is: installer )
	( login with ssh, and choose : Start installer (expert mode) )
    
    - Set up users and passwords
	- Enable shadow passwords? Yes
	- Allow login as root?  No     ( i say No No No... NO ...... NO  ) 
	- Fullname new user: (What you want.) Linux Admin
	- Username for your account: linuxadmin
	- Password for the new user: (louis default)
    - Configure the clock
	- Set the clock using NTP? Yes
	    - NTP server to use:  ( choose stratum 1 server, ntp1.nl.net )
	    - Timezone : Europe/Amsterdam   ( if you dont see you country/region go back to language, and set that correct. )
    - Detect disks
	- Partition disks
	    Manual (started, choose Guided - user entire disk. )
		Select disk, Create Empty (msdos) table
		Select partition, Create new partition... (Stop and think.) 
		Now, here the minimal i advice is 
		/   ( a samba AD DC, needed only 1.5GB for the complete OS install, set it to 8Gb as minimal )
		/var/log ( if you get a log run, it can fillup you partion and damage a samba database, 1Gb-2Gb more the ok )
		( this example shows 6GB for / and 1Gb /var/log)
		    New ( 6GB, Primary, beginning )
			Use as 			: ext4  
			mount point		: /
			Mount option	: (SSD, select discard) ( other keep default )
			Label			: OS_/
			Reserved blocks	: 5%    
			Typical usage	: standard    ( partitions with only large files ( iso/mkv/mov ) choose largefile4 ( adviced 500Mb+ files )
			Bootable flag	: on
		    Done setting up the partition
		    
		    New ( 1GB, Logical, beginning )
			Use as 			: ext4  
			mount point		: (Enter Manualy)  /var/log
			Mount option	: (SSD, select discard) ( other optional, noatime )
			Label			: OS_/var/log
			Reserved blocks	: 5%    
			Typical usage	: standard    ( partitions with only large files ( iso/mkv/mov ) choose largefile4 ( adviced 500Mb+ files )
			Bootable flag	: on
		    Done setting up the partition
		    
		    New ( 1,6GB, Logical, beginning )
			 Use as:         swap area 
		    Done setting up the partition
		Finish partitioning and write changes to disk ..
		
    -  Install the base system
	    Kernel to install:       		
                linux-image-4.9.0-3-amd64
		linux-image-amd64
		
		If you choose linux-image-4.9.0-3-amd64, you stay at 4.9.0 from stable. 
		If you choose linux-image-amd64, you keep following latest stable ( or backports)
		Personaly i choose linux-image-4.9.0-3-amd64, since i always keep the kernel where the system was installed with. 
		a "save bet" on trying a older kernel if you hit problems on the road.. 
		
	    Drivers to include in the initrd: 
		Now, generic is the best option
		if you know you are never going to move the server to other hardware, then targeted is an option. 
		( i did choose targeted since its a VM i use, and it save me some time. )
		
    - Configure the package manager 
	Scan another CD or DVD? No
	Use a network mirror? Yes
	Protocol for file downloads: http ( https is better, but easy to add later on. )
	Debian archive mirror country: Netherlands  
	Debian archive mirror: deb.debian.org or ftp.nl.debian.org
	 ( read : http://deb.debian.org for more info about this new host. )
	HTTP proxy information (blank for none):
	Use non-free software? Yes  ( you might need (linux) firmware packages)
	Enable source repositories in APT? No
	Services to use: 	[*] security updates (from security.debian.org)
			    [*] release updates
			    [ ] backported software                                                          
	Now i did not enable backported software, we only enabled it, then its really really needed. 
	
    - Select and install software

	 ( and : This choice can be later modified by running "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest".)
    
    - Software selection
	SSH server
	standard system utilities
	
	All other turn off, yes, even if you want apache or a print server, first AD DC setup. ;-)
	
    - Install the GRUB boot loader on a hard disk
	 Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?   Yes
	 Device for boot loader installation: ( for me /dev/xvda ) you /dev/sda probely. 
	 Force GRUB installation to the EFI removable media path?  No, ( i suggest, you keep the default )
    
    - Finish the installation  
	Is the system clock set to UTC? ( for me Yes ) you, i suggest, keep the default.

Part 2.1  The Samba AD-DC checkups. 

If you have correctly setup you samba server with Part 1. 
Then all these commands now work without any problems.

smbclient -L localhost -U%
smbclient //localhost/netlogon -UAdministrator -c 'ls'

host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.internal.example.com
host -t SRV _kerberos._udp.internal.example.com
host -t A server1ad.internal.example.com

kinit administrator
klist

Some NTP tests.
Run on linux : ntpq -qq Or ntpq -pn 127.0.0.1 or an other option is : apt-get install ntpstat and run run : ntpstat
If you see errors, first thing you should check if the following. 
On which interfaces and ipnumbers is ntp running: netstat -taupn|grep udp|grep ntp
And if you use the inteface lines, ( one or more ) interface listen ....  and sync fails check if ntp is trying on ipv6.
This command will tell you more about it: strace ntpq -pn ::1|& grep -i conn
Then first disable the inteface lines and try again.
